# CoffeeBot
A discord bot created using their java API (JDA) for personal use, can be used as a template for other bots.

This here is not the complete product that I use on my discord server, I removed some commands because they were unecessary for viewing.
Your own discord token is required if you want to run the bot, which can be obtained from the discord website, where you need to create your own bot.
The Java Discord API (JDA) is also needed to be able to use the source code.
